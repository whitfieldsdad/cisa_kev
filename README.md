# CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog client

A wildly opinionated Python 3 client for the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

## Features

- Automatically download the latest version of the CISA KEV catalog;
- Query the catalog using dataclasses, [Pandas](examples/list-ransomware-related-microsoft-vulnerabilities-with-pandas.py), or [Polars](examples/list-ransomware-related-microsoft-vulnerabilities-with-polars-sql.py);
- Query the catalog from the [command line](#command-line) and return the results in JSON, JSONL, CSV, or Parquet format; and
- Optionally disable the use of TLS certificate verification (i.e. for users operating within a network where TLS MitM is being performed, and [cisa.gov](https://cisa.gov) has not been allowlisted)

> ℹ️ The CISA KEV catalog will be downloaded to a file named `f70af4e5-602d-4b6f-a6cd-01be603ae2bb/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json` in the system's temporary directory by default

> ℹ️ The download location can be customized through both the library and command line
